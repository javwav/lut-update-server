1.01: Ares luts hadn't been added, my bad

# Trailer LUTs 1.0 and an important notice
- Added Kronos LUTs: Day and Night reused from Ouranos, Rain/Cloudy are a more exaggerated version of the rain seen in the story trailer gameplay and some other clips
- Added Ares LUTs: Day tries to get the look of an Ares concept art (more specifically when cloudy), Night tries to get the look of the Knuckles' short

The important notice:
First of all, all material from Chaos Island already looks like the final game, so there's not a lot to do.
On another note, I created the first version of this mod with the intention of making the game look very differently from what we've ever seen, not with the only purpose of making only trailer LUTs, but I messed up by calling this mod "Trailer LUTs". I'm sorry for not making RGB tables for the whole game, but this isn't the mod for it.
I'm sorry if I made your expectations too high. If you want to see new LUTs for the whole game, please wait for a new mod release on Gamebanana with the name "LUTs of Mine".

# Trailer LUTs 0.1
- Ouranos' night RGB table has been toned down a little in bright colors
- Day RGB table has been redone from scratch to be closer to the story trailer
